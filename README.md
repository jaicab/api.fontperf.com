# [fontperf.com API](https://fontperf.com/docs/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaicab/api.fontperf.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaicab/api.fontperf.com)

See [the documentation](https://fontperf.com/docs/).

- This is a **consumption-only** API (only the GET method is available).
- **No authentication** is required to access the API.
- If you are going to be regularly using the API, I recommend caching data on your service.
